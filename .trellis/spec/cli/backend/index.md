## How to Fill These Guidelines

For each guideline file:

1. Document your project's **actual conventions** (not ideals)
2. Include **code examples** from your codebase
3. List **forbidden patterns** and why
4. Add **common mistakes** your team has made

The goal is to help AI assistants and new team members understand how YOUR project works.

## Pre-Development Checklist

Before writing backend code, read the relevant guidelines based on your task:

- Database work → [database-guidelines.md](./database-guidelines.md)
- Error handling → [error-handling.md](./error-handling.md)
- Logging → [logging-guidelines.md](./logging-guidelines.md)
- Adding a platform → [platform-integration.md](./platform-integration.md)
- Script work → [script-conventions.md](./script-conventions.md)
- Migration system → [migrations.md](./migrations.md)

Also read [unit-test/conventions.md](../unit-test/conventions.md) — specifically the "When to Write Tests" section.

## Quality Check

After writing code, verify against these guidelines:

1. Run `git diff --name-only` to see what you changed
2. Read the relevant guidelines above for each changed area
3. Always check [quality-guidelines.md](./quality-guidelines.md)
4. Check if tests need to be added or updated:
   - New pure function → needs unit test
   - Bug fix → needs regression test
   - Changed init/update behavior → needs integration test update
5. Run lint and typecheck:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck
   ```

**Language**: All documentation should be written in **English**.
