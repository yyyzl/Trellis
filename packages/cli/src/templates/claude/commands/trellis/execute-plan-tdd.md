# Execute Plan TDD

Execute the active task's `plan.md` using strict TDD.

## Goal

Turn the current task's:

- `prd.md`
- `info.md`
- `plan.md`

into working code by following the plan slice by slice without skipping red-green-refactor.

## Preconditions

Before execution starts, verify:

- there is an active task
- `.trellis/tasks/<task>/plan.md` exists
- the plan is stable enough to execute
- you are not about to implement directly on `main` / `master` unless the user explicitly approved that

If `plan.md` is missing or unclear, stop and recommend `/fusion:write-task-plan`.

## Core Rules

1. **Review before execution**
   Read the whole plan first. If the plan has blockers, contradictions, or missing paths, stop and ask or return to planning.

2. **TDD is mandatory**
   No production code before a failing test that fails for the expected reason.

3. **One slice at a time**
   Complete the current slice before moving to the next one.

4. **Do not silently expand scope**
   Follow the plan and the PRD. If you discover a necessary change outside scope, surface it explicitly.

5. **Use minimal implementation**
   Implement only enough code to pass the current failing test.

6. **Verification is part of execution**
   Do not mark a slice complete without running its focused and broader checks.

7. **No fake completion**
   If blocked, say blocked. Do not report progress as complete when red/green verification has not happened.

## Workflow

### 1. Load execution context

Read:

- `prd.md`
- `info.md` if present
- `plan.md`
- relevant spec files for the files you will touch

Summarize the slice order before changing code.

### 2. Critically review the plan

Before writing code, check:

- are file paths concrete?
- are the first slices implementable?
- do the steps reflect the PRD and design?
- are the verification commands clear?

If the answer is no, stop and recommend `/fusion:write-task-plan`.

### 3. Execute slice by slice

For each slice:

1. identify the exact behavior under test
2. write the failing test first
3. run the focused test and confirm the failure is correct
4. write the minimal implementation to pass
5. rerun focused tests until green
6. refactor only while keeping tests green
7. run broader verification for the slice
8. confirm the slice matches the plan and PRD

### 4. Red-Green-Refactor checklist

For each behavior:

- [ ] failing test written first
- [ ] failure observed for the expected reason
- [ ] minimal implementation added
- [ ] focused tests pass
- [ ] broader checks run
- [ ] no extra behavior added beyond the slice

### 5. Stop conditions

Stop and ask for help when:

- the plan is missing critical detail
- the failing test passes immediately
- the failure is caused by a typo or broken test rather than missing behavior
- a broader verification fails repeatedly
- a required dependency or environment assumption is missing
- the next slice requires changing the agreed architecture

### 6. Final wrap-up

After all slices are complete:

1. summarize what was implemented
2. list the tests and checks run
3. note any remaining risks
4. recommend `/fusion:harvest-learnings`
5. after that, recommend `/trellis:check`
6. after that, recommend `/trellis:finish-work`
7. after human testing and commit, recommend `/trellis:record-session`

## Anti-Patterns

- reading only the first slice and not reviewing the full plan
- writing implementation before the failing test
- batching multiple slices before verification
- changing the plan ad hoc without telling the user
- skipping broader verification because focused tests passed
- treating "test added after implementation" as TDD

## Completion Message

Use a closing message shaped like this:

```text
Plan execution complete for <task-name>.

Completed slices:
- <slice 1>
- <slice 2>

Checks run:
- <focused tests>
- <broader checks>

Remaining risks:
- <none or short list>

Next steps:
1. Run /fusion:harvest-learnings
2. Run /trellis:check
3. Run /trellis:finish-work
4. After human testing and commit, run /trellis:record-session
```
